My Tableau Public site:

My GitHub repository for the CSV files, README.md, and Tableau workbook:

https://github.com/gamountainmama/tableau-challengeÂ 


I combined my six CSV files (for October 2022 - March 2023) using MongoDB, then exported them as a single CSV called bike_data.csv. The combined CSV file is too large to upload to GitHub, so I uploaded a compressed version.


I created worksheets in Tableau for the following investigations:


- A map of the starting station locations with zip code boundaries and color coding based on the frequency of use.

- A map of the ending station locations with zip code boundaries and color coding based on the frequency of use.

- A circle chart of bike types with size and color by type.

- A bar graph for the use frequency by month color coded by frequency.

- A two-way table of member/casual and bike type counts color coded by frequency.

- A bar graph of ride times by starting station color coded by bike type.

- A bar graph of ride times by ending station color coded by bike type.

I created the following dashboards:


- Side by side maps of starting and ending stations, color coded by frequency of use.

- Starting and ending station maps with bike type and member/casual rider filters.

- Starting the ending station maps with the time bar graph for filtering by month.

- Rider and bike type including counts, circle, and pie charts for filtering by rider type and bike type.

- Ride times by starting and ending station including rider and bike type counts for sorting by rider and bike types.


Finally, I created a story with trends from the data to share with the city council.
